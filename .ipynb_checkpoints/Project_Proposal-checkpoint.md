# Final Project Preliminary Proposal

## Motivation
Climate change is a challenge we are facing today and as step into the future. One way to be more aware of how we are impacting the natural environment is to pay attention to the resources from which we derive our energy. While alternative energy is clean energy, its  adoption is not as widespread as is necessary for the global temperature to stay within 1.5 degrees Celsius, as established by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. For the well-being of human health, the inspiration of nature, and preservation of natural systems, **I hope to uncover the relationships  that arise betweeen renewable energy and health to understand more about the effects of alternative energy methods.**


## Data
The dataset that I plan to use is from the United Nations' Environment Statistics. The UN is well-established and has resources to be able to collect data from multiple countries. The first dataset I will be looking at is  ["Energy Indicators"](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/envstats/Questionnaires/2019/Tables/Energy%20Indicators.xlsx); this dataset defines alternative energy as "renewable electricity production refers to the proportion of total electricity produced that comes from a renewable origin". This dataset is openly licensed according to the Open SDG Data Hub. Another dataset that I will be exploring is the World Health Organization's ["Infact mortality rate (between birth and 11 months per 1000 live births)"](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/infant-mortality-rate-(probability-of-dying-between-birth-and-age-1-per-1000-live-births)) dataset. This dataset is open license.

Some possible ethical considerations is thinking about how these datasets are gathered and how is collecting this information directly. Another thing to keep in mind is that relationships does not indicate casuality, these datasets will only be used to explore correlation. These datasets are suitable for addressing my research goal because it looks at the relationship between adoption of renewable energy and health factors.


## Unknowns
Something that may arise is a time constraint on my end. I will be gone for the third week of May so I will work on tackling my final project one step at a time and plan it accordingly so I will have ample time to complete this assignment while doing my best and thoughtful work.
